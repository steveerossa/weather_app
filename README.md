Weather App which provides upto a 7 day forecast for any city in the world
I completed the projected using AngularJS. The app queries the api.openweathermap.org for information about weather conditions. User can
choose between a 2, 5, or 7 day forecast from the current day. There is a search page and a results page. I used bootstrap for the layout.
